I got to be your friend now, baby
And I would like to move in just a little bit closer
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
I want your love
I want your love
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
